BG 3.19:1	The Supreme is the Personality of Godhead for the devotees, and liberation for the impersonalist. A person, therefore, acting for Kṛṣṇa, or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is told that he should ﬁght in the Battle of Kurukṣetra for the interest of Kṛṣṇa because Kṛṣṇa wanted him to ﬁght. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

BG 3.19:2	Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacriﬁces, are performed for puriﬁcation of impious activities that were performed in the ﬁeld of sense gratiﬁcation. But action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of Kṛṣṇa alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached.
