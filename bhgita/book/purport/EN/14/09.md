BG 14.9:1	A person in the mode of goodness is satisﬁed by his work or intellectual pursuit, just as a philosopher, scientist or educator may be engaged in a particular ﬁeld of knowledge and may be satisﬁed in that way. A man in the mode of passion may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as much as he can and spends for good causes. Sometimes he tries to open hospitals, give to charity institutions, etc. These are signs of one in the mode of passion. And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge. In the mode of ignorance, whatever one does is good neither for him nor for anyone.
