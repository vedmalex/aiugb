BG 9.24:1	Here it is clearly stated that there are many types of yajña performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yajña means Viṣṇu. In the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying Yajña, or Viṣṇu. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as varṇāśrama-dharma, is speciﬁcally meant for satisfying Viṣṇu. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa says in this verse, “I am the enjoyer of all sacriﬁces because I am the supreme master.” Less intelligent persons, however, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary beneﬁt. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulﬁlled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result.
