BG 9.16:1	The Vedic sacriﬁce known as Jyotiṣṭoma is also Kṛṣṇa, and He is also the Mahā-yajña mentioned in the smṛti. The oblations offered to the Pitṛloka or the sacriﬁce performed to please the Pitṛloka, considered as a kind of drug in the form of clariﬁed butter, is also Kṛṣṇa. The mantras chanted in this connection are also Kṛṣṇa. And many other commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacriﬁces are also Kṛṣṇa. The ﬁre is also Kṛṣṇa because ﬁre is one of the ﬁve material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of Kṛṣṇa. In other words, the Vedic sacriﬁces recommended in the karma-kāṇḍa division of the Vedas are in total also Kṛṣṇa. Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto Kṛṣṇa are to be understood to have performed all the sacriﬁces recommended in the Vedas.
