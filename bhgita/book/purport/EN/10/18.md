BG 10.18:1	A similar statement was made to Sūta Gosvāmī by the ṛṣis of Naimiṣāraṇya, headed by Śaunaka. That statement is:

BG 10.18:2	vayaṁ tu na vitṛpyāmauttama-śloka-vikrameyac chṛṇvatāṁ rasa-jñānāṁsvādu svādu pade pade

BG 10.18:3	“One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, who is gloriﬁed by excellent prayers. Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with Kṛṣṇa relish at every step the descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.” (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.1.19) Thus Arjuna is interested in hearing about Kṛṣṇa, and speciﬁcally how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.

BG 10.18:4	Now as far as amṛtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning Kṛṣṇa is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, ﬁction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about Kṛṣṇa. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. The Purāṇas are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.
