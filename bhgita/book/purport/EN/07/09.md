BG 7.9:1	Puṇya means that which is not decomposed; puṇya is original. Everything in the material world has a certain ﬂavor or fragrance, as the ﬂavor and fragrance in a ﬂower, or in the earth, in water, in ﬁre, in air, etc. The uncontaminated ﬂavor, the original ﬂavor, which permeates everything, is Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance and some taste. Vibhāvasu means ﬁre. Without ﬁre we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that ﬁre is Kṛṣṇa. The heat in the ﬁre is Kṛṣṇa. According to Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even for digestion ﬁre is needed. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness we become aware that earth, water, ﬁre, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material elements are due to Kṛṣṇa. The duration of man’s life is also due to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, man can prolong his life or diminish it. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is active in every sphere.
