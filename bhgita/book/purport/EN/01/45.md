BG 1.45:1	It is the custom – according to kṣatriya ﬁghting principles – that an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, decided that even if attacked by the enemy in such an awkward position, he would not ﬁght. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon ﬁghting. All these symptoms are due to soft-heartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord.
