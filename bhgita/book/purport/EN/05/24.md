BG 5.24:1	Unless one is able to relish happiness from within, how can one retire from the external engagements meant for deriving superﬁcial happiness? A liberated person enjoys happiness by factual experience. He can, therefore, sit silently at any place and enjoy the activities of life from within. Such a liberated person no longer desires external material happiness. This state is called brahma-bhūta, attaining which one is assured of going back to Godhead, back to home.
