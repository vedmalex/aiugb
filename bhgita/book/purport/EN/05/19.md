BG 5.19:1	Equanimity of mind, as mentioned above, is the sign of self-realization. Those who have actually attained to such a stage should be considered to have conquered material conditions, speciﬁcally birth and death. As long as one identiﬁes with this body, he is considered a conditioned soul, but as soon as he is elevated to the stage of equanimity through realization of self, he is liberated from conditional life. In other words, he is no longer subject to take birth in the material world but can enter into the spiritual sky after his death. The Lord is ﬂawless because He is without attraction or hatred. Similarly, when a living entity is without attraction or hatred, he also becomes ﬂawless and eligible to enter into the spiritual sky. Such persons are to be considered already liberated, and their symptoms are described below.
