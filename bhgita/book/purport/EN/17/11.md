BG 17.11:1	The general tendency is to offer sacriﬁce with some purpose in mind, but here it is stated that sacriﬁce should be performed without any such desire. It should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose of material beneﬁt, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer ﬂowers and eatables without any purpose of obtaining material beneﬁt. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic beneﬁt is not recommended in the scriptural injunctions. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
