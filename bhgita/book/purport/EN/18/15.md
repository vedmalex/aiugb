BG 18.15:1	The words “right” and “wrong” are very signiﬁcant in this verse. Right work is work done in terms of the prescribed directions in the scriptures, and wrong work is work done against the principles of the scriptural injunctions. But whatever is done requires these ﬁve factors for its complete performance.
