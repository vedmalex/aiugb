BG 18.3:1	There are many activities in the Vedic literature which are subjects of contention. For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacriﬁce, yet some maintain that animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal killing in a sacriﬁce is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacriﬁce is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacriﬁce, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a speciﬁc sacriﬁce it is good. All these different opinions on sacriﬁcial activity are now being clariﬁed by the Lord Himself.
