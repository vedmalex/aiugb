BG 18.6:1	Although all sacriﬁces are purifying, one should not expect any result by such performances. In other words, all sacriﬁces which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up, but sacriﬁces that purify one’s existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped. Everything that leads to Kṛṣṇa consciousness must be encouraged. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacriﬁce or charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord.
