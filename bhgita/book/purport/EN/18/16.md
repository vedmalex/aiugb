BG 18.16:1	A foolish person cannot understand that the Supersoul is sitting as a friend within and conducting his actions. Although the material causes are the place, the worker, the endeavor and the senses, the ﬁnal cause is the Supreme, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, one should see not only the four material causes but the supreme efﬁcient cause as well. One who does not see the Supreme thinks himself to be the doer.
