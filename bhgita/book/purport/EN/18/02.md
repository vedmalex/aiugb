BG 18.2:1	The performance of activities for results has to be given up. This is the instruction of Bhagavad-gītā. But activities leading to advanced spiritual knowledge are not to be given up. This will be made clear in the next verses. In the Vedic literature there are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacriﬁce for some particular purpose. There are certain sacriﬁces to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacriﬁces prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacriﬁce for the puriﬁcation of one’s heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up.
