BG 18.4:1	Although there are differences of opinion about renunciation, here the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, gives His judgment, which should be taken as ﬁnal. After all, the Vedas are different laws given by the Lord. Here the Lord is personally present, and His word should be taken as ﬁnal. The Lord says that the process of renunciation should be considered in terms of the modes of material nature in which it is performed.
