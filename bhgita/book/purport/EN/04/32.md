BG 4.32:1	Different types of sacriﬁce, as discussed above, are mentioned in the Vedas to suit the different types of worker. Because men are so deeply absorbed in the bodily concept, these sacriﬁces are so arranged that one can work either with the body, with the mind or with the intelligence. But all of them are recommended for ultimately bringing about liberation from the body. This is conﬁrmed by the Lord herewith from His own mouth.
