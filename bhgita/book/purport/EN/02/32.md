BG 2.32:1	As supreme teacher of the world, Lord Kṛṣṇa condemns the attitude of Arjuna, who said, “I do not ﬁnd any good in this ﬁghting. It will cause perpetual habitation in hell.” Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his speciﬁc duty. For a kṣatriya to be on the battleﬁeld and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools. In the Parāśara-smṛti, or religious codes made by Parāśara, the great sage and father of Vyāsadeva, it is stated:

BG 2.32:2	kṣatriyo hi prajā rakṣanśastra-pāṇiḥ pradaṇḍayannirjitya para-sainyādikṣitiṁ dharmeṇa pālayet

BG 2.32:3	“The kṣatriya’s duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difﬁculties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world.”

BG 2.32:4	Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from ﬁghting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets, whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his beneﬁt in either case.
