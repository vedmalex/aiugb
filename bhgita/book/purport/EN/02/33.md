BG 2.33:1	Arjuna was a famous ﬁghter, and he attained fame by ﬁghting many great demigods, including even Lord Śiva. After ﬁghting and defeating Lord Śiva in the dress of a hunter, Arjuna pleased the lord and received as a reward a weapon called pāśupata-astra. Everyone knew that he was a great warrior. Even Droṇācārya gave him benedictions and awarded him the special weapon by which he could kill even his teacher. So he was credited with so many military certiﬁcates from many authorities, including his adoptive father Indra, the heavenly king. But if he abandoned the battle, not only would he neglect his speciﬁc duty as a kṣatriya, but he would lose all his fame and good name and thus prepare his royal road to hell. In other words, he would go to hell not by ﬁghting but by withdrawing from battle.
