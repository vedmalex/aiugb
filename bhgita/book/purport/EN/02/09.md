BG 2.9:1	Dhṛtarāṣṭra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to ﬁght and was instead leaving the battleﬁeld for the begging profession. But Sañjaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his enemies (paran-tapaḥ). Although Arjuna was, for the time being, overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto Kṛṣṇa, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and would then surely ﬁght. Thus Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa and would ﬁght to the end.
