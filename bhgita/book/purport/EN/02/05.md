BG 2.5:1	According to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable action and has lost his sense of discrimination is ﬁt to be abandoned. Bhīṣma and Droṇa were obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because of his ﬁnancial assistance, although they should not have accepted such a position simply on ﬁnancial considerations. Under the circumstances, they have lost the respectability of teachers. But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless they remain his superiors, and therefore to enjoy material proﬁts after killing them would mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood.
