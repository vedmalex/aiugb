A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing sacriÔ¨Åces, undergoing austerities, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.
