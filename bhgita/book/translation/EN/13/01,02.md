Arjuna said: O my dear Kṛṣṇa, I wish to know about prakṛti [nature], puruṣa [the enjoyer], and the ﬁeld and the knower of the ﬁeld, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: This body, O son of Kuntī, is called the ﬁeld, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the ﬁeld.
